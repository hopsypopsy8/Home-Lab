### Intention
I would like to deepen my understanding of networking, security and system administration by working hands-on since cough uni didn't do that. Currently v1.0 will develop practical skills in firewall management, routing, server configuration. Obvious expansions will be adding in a SIEM and then similuating attacks on the system ("testing") 

### Topology v1.0

I went with a super basic initial topology since i've never done something like this and simple = better. I'm pretty sure that expanding this setup should be *easier* (especially since this is all vm hosted at the moment) however i am looking at buying a raspberry pi and configuring old computers to help with sharing load and just add additional end hosts which are not all essentially running on my one laptops hardware (fan jetplane noises).

## Device Setup
### pfSense
You can find the link for the .iso files below. Note if on windows you will need 7z or some equivalent to unzip the file.

still to do **a lot**
**talk about paravirtualized networks, internal network so all traffic goes thru pfSense (duh), what is WAN, setting up kali, using kali to**
